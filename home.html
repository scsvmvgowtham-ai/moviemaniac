          <h3>🎥 The Birth of Moving Pictures (1890s)</h3>
          <p>
            Cinema began as a magical curiosity in the late 19th century. In 1895, the Lumière brothers 
            projected "Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory" to a paying audience in Paris—the world's 
            first commercial film screening. Audiences were mesmerized by simple scenes of everyday life 
            brought to motion. A train arriving at a station supposedly caused viewers to leap from their 
            seats in terror, so novel was the experience of moving images.
          </p>
          <p>
            These early "actualities" were brief glimpses of reality, lasting mere seconds. Yet they 
            sparked an entertainment revolution that would transform human culture forever.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>🎭 The Silent Era: Stories Without Words (1900s-1920s)</h3>
          <p>
            As technology advanced, filmmakers discovered they could tell stories. The silent era gave 
            birth to cinema as an art form. Directors like D.W. Griffith pioneered narrative techniques—close-ups, 
            cross-cutting, and dramatic lighting—that remain fundamental today. Charlie Chaplin's "Little Tramp" 
            made the world laugh without uttering a word, proving that cinema could transcend language barriers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grand movie palaces sprouted in cities worldwide. Live orchestras accompanied the films, and 
            stars like Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford, and Rudolph Valentino became international icons. 
            Cinema had evolved from a novelty into a cultural phenomenon, drawing millions weekly to darkened 
            theaters to dream together.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>🔊 The Sound Revolution (1927-1930s)</h3>
          <p>
            "You ain't heard nothin' yet!" proclaimed Al Jolson in "The Jazz Singer" (1927), and he was right. 
            The arrival of synchronized sound—"talkies"—revolutionized cinema overnight. Silent film stars 
            whose voices didn't match their personas faded into obscurity, while new talents like James Cagney 
            and Katharine Hepburn rose to prominence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Musicals burst onto screens in glorious sound. Gangster films crackled with tommy gun fire and 
            snappy dialogue. The Golden Age of Hollywood had begun, establishing the studio system that would 
            dominate for decades. MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, and others became dream factories, churning 
            out hundreds of films annually.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>🌈 The Golden Age: Technicolor Dreams (1940s-1950s)</h3>
          <p>
            Color transformed cinema into a visual spectacle. "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) mesmerized audiences 
            as Dorothy stepped from sepia Kansas into the vibrant Technicolor world of Oz. "Gone with the Wind" 
            swept viewers into the grandeur of the Old South. Epic historical dramas, lavish musicals, and 
            sweeping romances defined this golden era.
          </p>
          <p>
            World War II brought propaganda and patriotic films, but also film noir—dark, cynical stories 
            reflecting post-war anxieties. Stars like Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Rita Hayworth 
            embodied a new sophistication. Cinema was no longer just entertainment; it was art, escapism, 
            and cultural commentary all at once.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>📺 The Television Challenge (1950s-1960s)</h3>
          <p>
            Television's rise threatened cinema's dominance. Hollywood responded with spectacle: widescreen 
            formats like CinemaScope, 3D experiments, and biblical epics like "Ben-Hur" (1959) that couldn't 
            be replicated on small screens. Drive-in theaters boomed, turning moviegoing into a social event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, international cinema flourished. Japanese masters like Akira Kurosawa, Italian 
            neorealists like Federico Fellini, and French New Wave directors like François Truffaut proved 
            that cinema was a universal language. Films became bolder, tackling controversial subjects and 
            experimenting with narrative structure.
          </p>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>🎸 New Hollywood & Blockbusters (1970s-1980s)</h3>
          <p>
            A new generation of film school-educated directors—Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven 
            Spielberg, George Lucas—revolutionized Hollywood. "The Godfather" (1972), "Jaws" (1975), and 
            "Star Wars" (1977) created the modern blockbuster, proving that films could be both artistic and 
            commercially massive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Special effects advanced dramatically. "Star Wars" pioneered motion control photography and spawned 
            Industrial Light & Magic. Audiences wanted bigger, louder, more spectacular experiences. The summer 
            blockbuster season was born, and merchandising transformed films into multimedia franchises.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>💻 The Digital Revolution (1990s-2000s)</h3>
          <p>
            Computer-generated imagery (CGI) transformed what was possible on screen. "Jurassic Park" (1993) 
            brought dinosaurs to life with unprecedented realism. "Toy Story" (1995) proved that entire films 
            could be computer-animated. The Matrix (1999) bent reality itself with groundbreaking visual effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital cameras began replacing film, democratizing filmmaking. Independent cinema thrived with 
            festivals like Sundance launching careers. The internet changed film distribution and marketing. 
            DVDs brought cinema into homes with unprecedented quality, supplemented by behind-the-scenes features 
            that deepened appreciation for the craft.
          </p>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>🌍 Global Cinema & Streaming Era (2010s-Present)</h3>
          <p>
            Cinema has become truly global. Bollywood produces more films than Hollywood. South Korean cinema 
            ("Parasite") wins Best Picture at the Oscars. Nigerian Nollywood is the world's second-largest film 
            industry by volume. Stories from every culture find worldwide audiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ have revolutionized distribution. 
            Films premiere simultaneously worldwide. Binge-watching culture has emerged. Yet theatrical cinema 
            endures—blockbusters like "Avatar: The Way of Water" and "Top Gun: Maverick" prove that audiences 
            still crave the communal experience of watching stories unfold on the big screen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="history-section">
          <h3>❤️ The Audience: Cinema's True Heart</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout cinema's evolution, one constant remains: the audience. From those first viewers ducking 
            from an onscreen train to modern fans debating Marvel theories online, audiences have shaped cinema 
            as much as filmmakers have.
          </p>
          <p>
            Movies give us heroes to admire, villains to despise, love stories to cherish, and adventures to 
            experience vicariously. They make us laugh until we cry, cry until we're exhausted, and think about 
            life in new ways. Cinema is a mirror reflecting society and a window into other worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            In darkened theaters or on glowing screens at home, we gather to share stories. We debate performances, 
            quote favorite lines, and replay iconic scenes in our minds. Movies become part of our personal history—
            marking first dates, family traditions, and cultural moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magic of cinema lies not just in the technology or artistry, but in that moment when light and 
            sound combine to transport us. For two hours, we forget ourselves and live other lives, visit other 
            worlds, and return changed—however slightly—by what we've experienced.
          </p>
          <p class="final-thought">
            <strong>This is why we love movies. This is why cinema endures. And this is why, over a century after 
            those first flickering images, we still gather in the dark to watch stories unfold—because cinema, 
            at its heart, is humanity's dream factory, and we all need to dream.</strong>
